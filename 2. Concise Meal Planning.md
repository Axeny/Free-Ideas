### #2 Concise Meal Planning

Lets face it, it's difficult to plan what to eat for a whole week and not many people do it. My partner takes care of meal planning and shopping lists to save us money so we don't wand aimlessly around the shops buying things we don't need and forgetting things we do need.

Concise meal planning could be a freemium web offering where you can specify a budget and a real person or smart algorithm will generate a meal plan for you, approximate cost within budget, dietary requirements and a shopping list. Integrate this with shopping data from actual stores and you've got a web service.
