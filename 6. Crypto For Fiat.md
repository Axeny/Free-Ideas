### #6 Crypto <For> Fiat

What was once thought of as a trend is now a real and popular thing. I am of course talking about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and the many others being actively bought and trade.

Unless you have a mining rig, are part of a crypto trading platform or already have coins to trade, getting into cryptocurrencies can be hard. Coupled with the fact people on eBay and forums are out to overcharge and rip people off, there's a serious space in the market to capitalise on.

Basically it's hard to buy cryptocoins unless of course you're only buying Bitcoin. This proposed platform would allow people to sell their crypto for fiat and or buy crypto with fiat.
