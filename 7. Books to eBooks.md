### #7 Books to eBooks

These days it's all about the eBook. Gone are the days of lugging around a heavy paperback novel which would be difficult to read with its small print and way in which you have to hold it.

Schools, libraries and charities of course still use the original paperback boook.

Books are heavy, and if you've ever had to move house and pack and move books then you would know how heavy they are in numbers.

Books to Ebooks would be a service that would allow you to trade in your old books for their eBook equivelent or if not available, any other eBook from the collection. There would be DRM rights issues to overcome with this problem, but wouldn't it be cool if you could recycle your books for eBooks?
