### #1: Massive Cryptocurrency API

There are more and more cryptocurrencies being created every day. A look on coinmarketcap.com yields quite a few, some worth more than others. The one issue with most of these coins is that it's not easy to accept each form of coin as a currency in say an eCommerce application.

Massive Cryptocurrency API would allow anyone to easily accept these coins, throw in a low transaction fee and you've got yourself a nice little money maker.
